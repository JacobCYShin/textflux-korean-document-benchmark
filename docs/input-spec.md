# Input Specification

## Data handling

Keep source documents, masks, style references, generated results, and review files outside Git. Use only documents approved for this experiment. Remove personal, account, transaction, and other sensitive information before creating a test set.

Recommended private layout:

```text
private-inputs/
  forms/
    form_001.png
  masks/
    form_001_name.png
  styles/
    form_003_reference_crop.png
```

The manifest paths are relative to `INPUT_ROOT`. Absolute paths and `..` segments are rejected.

## Source image

- Use an approved PNG, JPG, or JPEG scan or photograph representative of the target workflow.
- Preserve the final orientation and approximate production resolution.
- Do not use the upstream Chinese signboard example for this benchmark.
- For content-only cases, use a target-like form and a target field. A blank field is acceptable.
- For handwriting-style cases, retain approved style evidence outside the target mask, or record a separate style reference. A blank form alone cannot establish a writer-specific style target.

## Mask image

- The mask must have exactly the same pixel dimensions as the source image.
- Use black (`0`) outside the editable field and white (`255`) inside it.
- Cover all existing target text plus a small, documented margin. Do not crop parts of existing glyphs.
- Do not expand the mask across adjacent labels, ruled lines, stamps, or fields unless their regeneration is part of the test.
- Inspect the mask at 100% zoom before running inference.

The validator accepts grayscale or RGB masks but rejects masks that are empty, full-frame, or materially non-binary.

## Text and field types

`text` is embedded in the UTF-8 JSONL manifest. Use one line per case for the initial single-line benchmark.

Allowed `field_type` values:

- `hangul`
- `amount`
- `currency`
- `account`
- `swift`
- `date`
- `identifier`
- `mixed`

For `amount`, `currency`, `account`, `swift`, `date`, and `identifier`, punctuation and case are part of the value. Review against the entire expected string.
